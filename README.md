# Interview Scheduler

A single-page interview scheduler app developed while studying React at the Lighthouse Labs Web Development bootcamp, week 7. I found React intuitive and enjoyable to work with. I also used Storybook to work on UI components, as well as Jest and Cypress for testing. 

## Setup

Install dependencies with `npm install`.

## Running Webpack Development Server

```sh
npm start
```

Data for the app is stored in a PostgreSQL database, which can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/tw77/scheduler-api) along with instructions for setting up the API server.

## Running Jest Test Framework

```sh
npm test
```

## Running Storybook Visual Testbed

```sh
npm run storybook
```
